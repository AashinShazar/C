# Game of Pig Assignment
## Project: Introduction to C

## Project Overview
Pig is a simple dice game first described by John Scarne in 19451. It is a form of jeopardy dice game, where a players decisions are between protecting current gains, or risking current gains to make greater gains. In Pig, each player takes a turn rolling a 6-sided dice, playing to reach a certain total (typically 100). If a player rolls a value between 2 and 6 it is added to their score, and they can roll again. If they roll a 1 (a “pig”), they lose their turn and add nothing to their score. At any point after rolling a 2-6, the player may choose to to hold, which ends their turn, and adds their turn total to their score. The winner is the first player to get a score greater than or equal to the total. When looking at the simple rules of the game, one can surmise that the game involves some form of repetition to deal with the different turns of the players, and decision statements to deal with the choice of roll or hold. The game also involves a random number generator to simulate the dice.

## Description
Design and implement a C program to play the Game of Pig. The game will be played with two human players taking alternate turns. The total for the game (which is typically 100), should be input by the user before the game begins. The program should display the dice rolled, for example:

+-------+
| O   O |
|   O   |
| O   O |
+-------+

Below is a skeleton for a function called showDice(). This function has one parameter, the number rolled by the “dice” (random number). It displays that appropriate graphic. This is a basic function and does not require any special knowledge.

void showDice(int num)
{
}

Your program should include the following: decision statements, loops, character input, random number generation.
